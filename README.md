# Kronig-Penney-Model
This repository contains codes for modelling the Kronig-Penney model from 7th chapter of Kittel's book named: "Solid State physics: 8th Ed"  
I explained details and descriptions about the code, line by line; and I tried to make it easy to read and follow the code.  
You can see code files in two formats; .py & .ipynb .
